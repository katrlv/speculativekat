# Speculative Design Project 1: Drug-detector Prototype

## Summary

For this speculative design project, my team was assigned to use speculative design strategies and critical making to create a speculative user experience which would engage the user's somatic senses. We wanted to design a device that would help to ensure a user's safety, eventually narrowing down our focus to creating a safety device that would protect against sexual assault. Our design involved a rape drug detector component, which, when attached to a drinking glass, would be able to alert the user via vibration if a drink were ever detected to be spiked. My team collaborated to create a prototype using recycled plastic materials to demonstrate our drug-detecting device.

## Problem

Our speculative design project aimed to solve two problems:

How might we...

- Allow users to use our device in an natural and effortless manner, to reduce the hassle while on a night out?
- Create a device that is easy-to-approach and does not make uncomfortable demands from the user (ie. having to touch their drink in order to test it)?

To address these problems, we decided to create a physical prototype to demonstrate our drug-detector device components and their usage.

## Process

To initiate our speculative design process, we conducted research on what relevant technologies currently existed in the areas of haptic safety systems and drink-tampering prevention. It was necessary to take this initial step in order to understand what opportunities there were for our project to further innovate as a haptic drink-tampering prevention device.

I was mainly involved in researching haptic safety technologies for this project. I learned about haptic steering wheels, as well as haptic firefighter helmets, and their use of vibration alerts to immediately focus the user's attention on completing tasks essential to their own, and other's, safety. Researching these technologies allowed me and my team to understand that our product would need a vibration alert strong enough to catch the user's attention in distracting environments like entertainment venues, without breaking the discreetness of the device.

We discussed a lot about creating the most comfortable experience possible for users, as our research on current drink-tampering prevention devices showed us that many would require the user to engage in unconventional actions, such as bringing the liquid of their drink in contact with nail polish or a ring. Initially we imagined our drug detection component to be one component only, being dropped into the drink to test for drugs, but we figured it would not be comfortable for users to retrieve the wet device once finished their beverage. 

Eventually, we opted for our device to be composed of 2 magnetic components, with one attaching to the exterior of the glass to enable the user to remove the interior component without needing to come in contact with any residual liquid.

## Reflection

My team presented a prototype made out of two thin plastic cut-outs to represent our drug-detecting components. We placed one cut-out on the interior of a drinking glass, and the other on the exterior to demonstrate how users would be interacting with our product. Our prototype allowed us to explain the vibration alert which users would be able to sense immediately through the glass if a rape drug were to be detected in their drink. 

This project was my first experience designing using speculative design methods. The research phase, where we looked at what technologies currently existed and imagined where things could head in the future, was incredibly useful in paving the way for the final model we chose for our device. I think keeping this speculative strategies in mind will help me immensely in the early stages of future design projects.
